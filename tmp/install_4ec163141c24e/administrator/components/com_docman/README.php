About DOCman
------------
DOCman is an open source document management and download system for Joomla! v1.5. With this component you can manage documents across categories and make them available for download.

These are the main features of DOCman:

* Infinite categories and subcategories. The documents can be organized across custom categories and subcategories;
* Files can be hosted locally or on a remote server
* Access control: Documents can be assigned to specific user or to custom groups of users
* Download counter and log. You can display a download counter per document and all the downloads can be logged (by user, IP, browser, date and hour);
* Own search system. Documents can be searched by name and/or description. The search system integrates with Joomla! using an optional mambot;
* Anti-leech system. The built-in anti-leech system avoids direct linking to documents;
* Path protection. Real paths to documents are never displayed to users;
* Themes: The layout can be changed using custom themes;
* ... and much more!
